# intern-demo
old company's demo work, intern level

This repository contains a website project developed during my internship.
The project focuses on structure, layout, and real-world website features used in a corporate environment.

Due to expired service tokens (Cloudbeds), the live version is currently unavailable. However, the full source code, structure, and design are included for review and **VIEW ONLY**.

📌 Project Overview
Type: Tour Website
- Made with frontend structure, logic flow, and integration in mind
- Includes:
    Website layout & styling
    Sitemap setup
    Robots configuration
    Structured folders similar to real-world production projects

⚠️ The website cannot be fully demonstrated online because the Cloudbeds token has expired.

However: All logic and structure remain intact, code is readable and well-organized, design assets and layout are fully included!
You can review the implementation directly through the source files.

The project follows a clean structure used in real companies, including: Page routing, asset organization and SEO-related files (sitemap, robots.txt)

This project reflects my learning and experience during my internship.
